## I'm not maintaing this theme anymore. I don't know if it will work on newer versions of joplin. 

## VSCode [Community Material Theme](https://github.com/material-theme/vsc-material-theme) for Joplin
It's not 100% identical and there are rooms for improvment. Mostly background colors are changed and everything else is Joplin's default UI and your system default font.

This theme is a modified version of [Joplin Light Theme](https://github.com/LongBay/Joplin-Light-Theme) by [LongBay](https://github.com/LongBay) originally [Joplin Clear UI theme](https://github.com/marcteys/joplin-theme-clearUI) by [Marc Teyssier](https://github.com/marcteys).
 
## How to Install
Enable one of the dark themes in joplin and copy `userchrome.css` and `usersyle.css` to your joplin config folder. in GNU/Linux `~/.config/joplin-desktop`
